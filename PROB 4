Create a program that will accept three numbers as input and display the LARGEST number
of the three. See the sample output below:
Enter first number: 12
Enter second number: 36
Enter third number: 24
The LARGEST of the three numbers is 36.

#include iostream
using namespace std;

int main()

{
	double n1, n2, n3;
	
	cout  Enter first number ;
	cin  n1;
	cout  Enter second number ;
	cin  n2;
	cout  Enter third number ;
	cin  n3;
	
	if ((n1  n2) && (n1  n3))
		cout  The LARGEST of the three is   n1  endl;
	else if ((n2  n1) && (n2  n3))
		cout  The LARGEST of the three is   n2  endl;
	else
		cout  The LARGEST of the three is   n3  endl;
		
	return 0;
}
