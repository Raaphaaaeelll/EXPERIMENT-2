Write a program that computes a customer’s water bill. The bill includes a P35 water demand
charge plus a consumption(use) charge of P1.10 for every gallon used. Consumption is figured from meter
readings in gallons taken recently and during the previous month. If the customer’s unpaid balance is
greater than 0, a P20 late charge is assessed as well.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()

{
	int gallons;

	cout << "Enter the gallon of water consumed based on the meter reading: "; 
	cin >> gallons;
	
	if (gallons < 0)
		{
			cout << "Invalid amount! Please run the program again and enter a valid value to proceed to payment."; 
		}
	else
	
		{
			float DemandCharge = 35, ConsumptionCharge = 1.10, TotalCharge = DemandCharge + (ConsumptionCharge * gallons), TotalLateCharge = TotalCharge + 20, AmountPaid; 
	
			cout << "Total Charge = " << TotalCharge << endl;
			cout << "Enter amount of payment ";
			cin >> AmountPaid;
	
			if (AmountPaid < TotalCharge) 
	
				{
					cout << "Your water bill costs " << TotalLateCharge << ", including an additional late charge fee of P20. Please pay proper amount: ";
					cin >> AmountPaid;
			
					if (AmountPaid < TotalLateCharge) 
	
						{	
							cout << "Invalid payment! Please run the program again to pay right amount." << endl; 
						}
				
					else
					
						{	
							cout << "Payment accepted! You have a total change of " << AmountPaid - TotalLateCharge << "." << endl;
						}
				}
	
			else
			
				{
					cout << "Payment accepted! Your water bill costs " << TotalCharge << " with a total change of " << AmountPaid - TotalCharge << "." << endl; 
				}
		}
		
	return 0;
}
