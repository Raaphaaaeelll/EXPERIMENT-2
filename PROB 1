An Internet service provider has 3 different subscription packages for its customers:
Package A: For P995/mo 10 hrs of access are provided. Additional hours are P20/hr.
Package B: For P1495/mo 20 hrs of access are provided. Additional hours are P10/hr.
Package C: For P1995/mo of unlimited access is provided.
Write a program that calculates a customerâ€™s monthly bill. It should ask which package the customer has
purchased and how many hours were used. It should then display the total amount due.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()

{
	int package;
	double hours, cost;
	
    cout << "Subscription Packages:\n ";
    cout << "1. Package A: For P995/mo 10 hrs of access are provided. Additional hours are P20/hr.\n";
    cout << "2. Package B: For P1495/mo 20 hrs of access are provided. Additional hours are P10/hr.\n";
    cout << "3. Package C: For P1995/mo of unlimited access is provided.\n";
    cout << "Enter number of package:";
    cin >> package;
	
    cout << "How many hours have been used? ";
    cin >> hours;
    
    switch(package)
    {
    case 1:
    	cout << "Cost = " << 995 + (hours - 10) * 20 << endl;
    	break;
    case 2:
    	cout << "Cost = " << 1495 + (hours - 20) * 20 << endl;
    	break;
    case 3:
    	cout << "Cost = 1995 " << endl;
    	break;
    default:
    	cout << "Invalid input!";
	}
	
	return 0;
}
