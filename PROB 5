Create a program that will “count” numbers, separated by commas, up to 10. When it
reaches 10, count by 2s until you reach 30. See the sample output below:
Counting…
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,26,28,30

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()

{
	int x;
	
	cout << "Counting... \n";
	
	for (x = 1; x < 10; x++)
		{
			cout << x << ",";
		}
	for (x = 10; x >= 10, x <= 30; x+=2)
		{
			cout << x << ",";
		}
		
	cout << "\b";
	cout << " ";
	
	return 0;
}
